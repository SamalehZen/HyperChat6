## Summary
Adds a reusable animated gradient background overlay and integrates it into the chat input empty/new-thread state. The overlay appears on the very first visit and for each newly created thread until the first message is sent, then hides immediately upon send. Implementation is SSR-safe and does not affect input interactions or existing layout behavior.

## Why
- Provide a welcoming, high-quality visual cue in the empty/new-thread state without altering core flows.
- Reduce perceived emptiness on initial visit and new-thread creation while keeping UX fast and unobtrusive.
- Persist visibility state across the session/visits to avoid flicker or repeated prompts.

## What changed
- UI: packages/ui/src/components/animated-gradient-background.tsx
  - Framer Motion for entrance fade-in.
  - requestAnimationFrame-driven breathing gradient with cleanup on unmount.
  - Type-safe props with defaults (Breathing enabled by default).
- UI Barrel: packages/ui/src/components/index.ts
  - Exports AnimatedGradientBackground for import via @repo/ui (a.k.a. @hyperchat/ui in app context).
- Common: packages/common/components/chat-input/animated-input.tsx
  - Adds showIntroOverlay with SSR-safe storage guards:
    - First visit: localStorage 'hc_hasSeenFirstVisitGradient'.
    - New thread (0 messages): sessionStorage 'hc_gradientShownForThread-<threadId>' and 'hc_gradientHiddenForThread-<threadId>'.
  - Renders overlay behind content via an absolutely positioned container with pointer-events-none and -z-10.
  - Hides overlay immediately on send (before model response) and sets the per-thread hidden flag.

## Behavior
- First visit to /chat with no thread and no messages → overlay shows; set 'hc_hasSeenFirstVisitGradient' to '1'.
- New thread (/chat/<newId> with 0 messages) → overlay shows for that thread until the first send; set shown/hidden flags in sessionStorage.
- After first message is sent → overlay hides instantly; returning to that thread with messages will not show the overlay.
- Overlay does not block interactions and does not alter centering/bottom placement logic of AI_Prompt.

## Implementation notes
- All window/localStorage/sessionStorage access is guarded with typeof window !== 'undefined' to avoid SSR warnings.
- The overlay is rendered with className: "absolute inset-0 -z-10 pointer-events-none" so it stays behind all content.
- No breaking changes; only additive UI functionality.

## Test plan
1. Visit /chat with no existing threads: overlay visible behind centered prompt and greetings; send a message → overlay hides immediately and prompt moves to bottom.
2. Create a new thread (/chat/<uuid>) with zero messages: overlay visible; send first message → overlay hides immediately; navigate back later (with messages) → overlay does not show.
3. Verify the overlay does not block typing, model selectors, or buttons.
4. Check console for SSR/storage warnings (none expected).
